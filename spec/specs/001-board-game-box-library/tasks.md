# Tasks: Board Game Box Library

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-board-game-box-library/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test-first per constitution Principle IV — fast pure-Python tests included for all implementation phases.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

- [x] T033 [US2] Wire all box types into registry and verify `Project.box(BoxType.X, ...)` dispatches correctly in `pyboxbuilder/box/registry.py`

**Checkpoint**: All 14 box types functional — any type selectable via enum

---

## Phase 5: User Story 9 - Decorate Lids with Labels, Patterns, and Print-Optimized Color Layers (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Lids get auto-sized labels (framed/frameless/diagonal), through-hole patterns (hex, grid, voronoi), three accent colors per lid. Min text height guard skips illegible labels.

**Independent Test**: Create a lid with "Animals" text, hex-grid through-holes, and framed diagonal label; verify correct color assignments in 3MF.

**Checkpoint**: Lid decoration fully functional — labels, patterns, colors

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - Finger Cutouts for Easy Piece Removal (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Compartments can have finger scoops on any side wall or floor notch for shallow compartments.

**Independent Test**: Compartment with front finger scoop admits a 14mm radius sphere at the scoop cutout.

### Tests for User Story 3

**Checkpoint**: Compartments auto-laid-out in rows, grouped compartments stay adjacent

---

## Phase 8: User Story 7 - Auto-Size Sub-Boxes and Fill Gaps with Spacers (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Sub-boxes with minimum dimensions auto-expand to fill rows. Row lengths align. Gaps > 10mm produce hollow spacer trays. Gaps < 10mm absorbed by adjacent boxes.

**Independent Test**: 4 sub-boxes in a 300x200mm game box produce rows with common lengths and spacers for gaps > 10mm.

### Tests for User Story 7

- [x] T063 [US7] Wire `Project.export()` → packing solver → auto-sizing with `final_size` propagation → spacer generation in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`

**Checkpoint**: Multi-box games with auto-sizing and spacers fully functional

---

## Phase 9: User Story 8 - Export 3MF Files with Content-Based Caching (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: `Project.export()` produces organized 3MF files in `{out_dir}/{game}/mmu/` and `{out_dir}/{game}/single/`. Hausdorff comparison skips unchanged files. Two-level cache (memory + disk JSON with SHA-256 hash) speeds repeated renders.

**Independent Test**: Export a 2-box project twice; first writes files, second skips all. Modify one box; only that box's files are rewritten.

### Tests for User Story 8

- [x] T064 [P] [US8] Write unit test: ExportResult file counts match expectations in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_export.py`
- [x] T065 [P] [US8] Write unit test: cache hit/miss based on SHA-256 hash using `.layout_cache.json` in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_packing.py`
- [x] T066 [P] [US8] Write render test: second export writes 0 files (Hausdorff skip) in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/render/test_export_render.py`
- [x] T067 [P] [US8] Write render test: partial change exports only modified files in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/render/test_export_render.py`

### Implementation for User Story 8

- [x] T068 [P] [US8] Implement `ExportResult` frozen dataclass in `pyboxbuilder/export/result.py`
- [x] T068a [US8] Implement MMU color-copy logic (positive inserts in different material/color from body) in `pyboxbuilder/export/exporter.py` *(written 2026-08-13 — `BoxExporter._compose` keeps inserts as distinct objects in mmu, fuses them in single)*
- [x] T068b [US8] Implement bounding-box reporting for each exported piece (FR-027) in `pyboxbuilder/export/exporter.py` *(written 2026-08-13 — `PieceBounds`, surfaced as `Project.piece_bounds`)*
- [x] T069 [P] [US8] Implement two-level layout cache (in-memory dict + disk `pyboxbuilder/.layout_cache.json`, SHA-256 key, version invalidation) to store 3D box packing layouts and bypass solver on subsequent runs in `pyboxbuilder/packing/cache.py`
- [x] T070 [US8] Implement `BoxExporter` with per-box/per-spacer 3MF file writing in `pyboxbuilder/export/exporter.py` *(written 2026-08-13 — `Project.export` used to `touch()` empty files; it now exports real 3MF geometry through the `openscad` module)*
- [x] T071 [US8] Implement Hausdorff conditional write (pymeshlab compare, skip if distance < 0.001mm) in `pyboxbuilder/export/hausdorff.py` *(written 2026-08-13 — falls back to a `<mesh>`-only digest when pymeshlab is absent, because 3MF stamps a timestamp and fresh UUIDs on every write and so never matches byte for byte)*
- [x] T072 [US8] Implement organized output directory structure (`mmu/` + `single/`, `_body.3mf` / `_lid.3mf` naming) in `pyboxbuilder/export/exporter.py` *(moved out of `project.py` into `BoxExporter` 2026-08-13)*
- [x] T073 [US8] Wire full `Project.export()` pipeline: pack with dynamic dimension expansion → auto-size with `final_size` propagation → spacers → build → export in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`

**Checkpoint**: Full export pipeline functional — cached, Hausdorff-gated, organized output

---

## Phase 10: User Story 5 + User Story 6 - Nested Boxes & Manual Positioning (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Nested sub-boxes inside a game box with validation. Manual compartment positioning overrides auto-layout.

**Independent Test**: Outer box 300x300x80mm with 4 sub-boxes fits without overlap. Manual (x,y) positions applied correctly.

### Tests for User Story 5/6

- [x] T074 [P] [US5] Write unit test: 4 sub-boxes fit in 300x300x80mm outer box in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_packing.py`
- [x] T075 [P] [US6] Write unit test: manual positions override auto-layout in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_compartments.py`

### Implementation for User Story 5/6

- [x] T076 [US5] Implement validation: sub-boxes fit within outer interior (footprint + height) with descriptive errors in `pyboxbuilder/packing/layout.py`
- [x] T077 [US6] Implement manual compartment positioning (explicit x, y coordinates) in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/layout.py`
- [x] T078 [US6] Implement overlap detection and error reporting for manually positioned compartments in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/layout.py`

**Checkpoint**: Nested box validation and manual positioning functional

---

## Phase 10b: User Story 10 - Generate Packing Layout PDF Guide (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: `project.export()` produces a `layout.pdf` in the output directory containing multiple pages representing distinct stacking layers (e.g. Base Layer, Middle Layer, Top Layer). On each page, the boxes belonging to that layer are drawn in full color, while already-placed boxes are drawn in light gray. Boxes are labeled, colored, and numbered in packing order. PDF is cached: only regenerated when layout or library version changes.

**Independent Test**: Export a 4-box game, verify `layout.pdf` exists showing 4 labeled boxes at correct positions across one or more pages.

### Tests for User Story 10

- [x] T078a [P] [US10] Write unit test: PDF file exists in output directory after export in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_export.py`
- [x] T078b [P] [US10] Write unit test: PDF skipped on re-export when layout unchanged in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_export.py`

### Implementation for User Story 10

- [x] T078c [US10] Implement 3D oblique projection packing layout renderer (outlines, labels, dimensions, spacer markers) in `pyboxbuilder/export/layout_pdf.py`
- [x] T078d [US10] Implement packing order numbering, colored 3D shaded boxes, vertical exploded displacement, and dashed alignment lines in `pyboxbuilder/export/layout_pdf.py`
- [x] T078e [US10] Implement PDF caching with SHA-256 layout hash (skip regeneration if unchanged) in `pyboxbuilder/export/layout_pdf.py`
- [x] T078f [US10] Wire PDF generation into `Project.export()` pipeline and add `layout.pdf` to `ExportResult` in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`

**Checkpoint**: Packing layout PDF generated and cached alongside 3MF exports

- [x] T131 [P] Create golden-image render tests for box bodies/lids (sliding, cap, hinge, no-lid, stackable, magnetic) using `compare_images` against `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/golden/` in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/render/test_boxes_golden.py`

## Phase 12: Element Packing & Emberleaf (FR-004a / FR-004b)

**Purpose**: Individual per-piece slots inside a compartment, and the Emberleaf reference example that exercises them.

**Goal**: A compartment can hold many individually-placed silhouettes — a slot per worker meeple, per hero standee, per hex tile — each at its own offset, rotation and depth, with the pack's bounding box packing like an ordinary rectangle. `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py` reproduces `examples/emberleaf.scad`.

**Independent Test**: Load the Emberleaf example and verify five separate slots exist per worker species, each with its own SVG silhouette, none overlapping the hero or breaking a wall.

### Element packing

- [x] T138 [P] Implement `CompartmentElement` with per-element shape, offset, rotation, depth and z-offset in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/element.py`
- [x] T139 [P] Implement `ElementShape` enum (SVG, RECT, ROUNDED_RECT, CIRCLE, HEXAGON, SPHERE_SCOOP) in `pyboxbuilder/enums.py`
- [x] T140 [P] Implement shape-aware footprints — exact rotated hexagon extent, rotation-invariant discs — in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/element.py`
- [x] T141 [P] Implement element-pack helpers (`grid_pack`, `normalize_elements`, `elements_footprint`, `elements_overlap`) in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/element.py`
- [x] T142 [US4] Derive a compartment's size from its element pack's bounding box (FR-004b) in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/builder.py`
- [x] T143 [P] Implement SVG silhouette extrusion with a parse cache (`svg_solid`) in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/element.py`
- [x] T144 [P] Write test: element footprints, packs, overlap detection and pack-derived sizing in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_elements.py`

### Carving compartments into bodies

- [x] T145 [US1] Implement `build_contents` — turn compartment placements into the solid subtracted from a body — in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/carve.py`
- [x] T146 [US1] Hollow a box wholesale only when it has no compartments; otherwise the compartments are the cavities. `pyboxbuilder/box/shell.py` + `Project.export`
- [x] T147 [US1] Clip compartment wells to the interior footprint so none breaks through a side wall (FR-018), while finger scoops stay unclipped because piercing a wall is their job, in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/carve.py`
- [x] T148 [US3] Rewrite the finger scoops for correct anchoring, with an automatic wall-notch → floor-bowl fallback for shallow compartments, in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/finger_hole.py`

### Geometry anchoring correction

- [x] T149 Extract the shared `build_shell` / `block` / `corner` placement helpers in `pyboxbuilder/box/shell.py`, replacing the copy of `outer - inner` in all 13 box types
- [x] T150 Correct every box type for pybosl2's **centre**-anchored primitives — bodies were being cut off-centre, leaving boxes with two walls instead of four — in `pyboxbuilder/box/types/`
- [x] T151 Rebuild the CapBox and SlipoverBox lids as real skirted caps rather than flat plates in `pyboxbuilder/box/types/`
- [x] T152 Regenerate the golden images, which had captured the off-centre bodies, and align `generate_golden.py`'s dimensions with the test's in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/`

### Emberleaf reference example

- [x] T153 Rewrite `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py` to derive every dimension with the same formula as `examples/emberleaf.scad`
- [x] T154 Place all 21 boxes at the positions `BoxLayout()` uses, with no overlaps and nothing overhanging the game box
- [x] T155 Give each of the five owl / rabbit / frog / rat workers its own silhouette slot at the original's pitch, plus the per-colour hero, in `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py`
- [x] T156 Reproduce the marker pockets, victory-token stack, hex tiles and pull-out depressions at their individual depths in `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py`
- [x] T157 Reproduce the CommonBox hex grid, trophy well and trophy marker in `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py`
- [x] T158 [P] Write test: Emberleaf dimensions, layout, per-worker slots and export match the original in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_emberleaf.py`
- [x] T159 [P] Write test: BoxExporter, mesh-equivalence gating, row sizing and PathBox in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_exporter.py`
- [x] T160 Fix `should_regenerate_layout` writing its hash only on the second run, which rebuilt an already-current PDF, in `pyboxbuilder/export/layout_pdf.py`

**Checkpoint**: Element packs functional; Emberleaf exports real 3MF files plus a layout PDF, and a re-export rewrites nothing.

---

## Phase 13: Fewest-Possible Spacers (FR-014a/b/c)

**Purpose**: The leftover space should produce as few trays as it can, and they should be liftable.

**Goal**: Spacer count depends only on the shape of the empty space, not on how many boxes the layout contains. Emberleaf gets its three spacers from the packer instead of declaring them.

**Independent Test**: Export Emberleaf and verify exactly three spacers, at the corners of the original's `SpacerPlayer`, `SpacerSide` and `SpacerFront`.

- [x] T164 Move the 3D sweep out of `Project.export` into `pyboxbuilder/packing/spacer.py` as `sweep_free_space`
- [x] T165 Take the largest available box at each sweep step instead of scanning in index order, so a sliver cannot claim cells out of a big void and fragment it (FR-014a)
- [x] T166 Implement `merge_voids` — fuse any two voids whose union is a box, to a fixed point, in canonical order (FR-014b)
- [x] T167 Implement `apply_clearance` — inset a tray's footprint by the project's `clearance_slack` so it can be lifted out (FR-014c)
- [x] T168 Add `Project.min_spacer_height` and wire `Project.export` to `generate_spacer_placements` (sweep → merge → shrink → filter)
- [x] T169 Turn on `generate_spacers` for Emberleaf and delete its three hand-declared spacers in `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py`
- [x] T170 [P] Write test: merge fuses on every axis, is idempotent, is order-independent, and leaves an L-shape at two (SC-010b) in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_spacer_merge.py`
- [x] T171 [P] Write test: swept voids never overlap each other or a placed box, and a sliver does not fragment its neighbour (FR-014a) in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_spacer_merge.py`
- [x] T172 [P] Write test: Emberleaf produces exactly three spacers at the original's corners (SC-010a) in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_emberleaf.py`

**Checkpoint**: Emberleaf's spacers are derived, not declared — three trays, down from the four the un-merged sweep produced. 1835 still produces exactly one.

### Rectilinear merge — L/T/U leftovers as one polygon tray (FR-014d/e)

- [x] T174 Add `pyboxbuilder/paths.py` — rectilinear polygon helpers (`polygon_area`, `is_rectilinear`, `inset_rectilinear`, `bounds`) shared by the spacer pass and `PathBox`
- [x] T175 Implement `union_outline` — trace the boundary of a union of footprints by edge cancellation, collapsing collinear runs, in `pyboxbuilder/packing/spacer.py`
- [x] T176 Implement `merge_rectilinear` — group coplanar voids into connected clusters and emit one polygon-footprint `Void` per cluster (FR-014d)
- [x] T177 Refuse to fuse voids at different heights, which would replace two flat trays with one overhanging part (FR-014e)
- [x] T178 Add `Placement.path` and build polygon spacers through `BoxType.PATH` in `Project.export`
- [x] T179 Replace `PathBox._inset_path`'s centroid scale with the exact rectilinear inset, which a centroid scale gets wrong on any reflex corner
- [x] T180 [P] Write test: L/T/U/plus outlines trace correctly, polygon area is preserved, stacked voids stay apart, and an inset L stays rectilinear on all six sides in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_spacer_merge.py`

**Checkpoint**: A corner box in an otherwise empty layer yields one six-point L tray instead of two rectangles, and it builds as a real hollow `PathBox`.

### Packing correctness — found while evaluating auto-packing for Emberleaf

- [x] T181 Fix `expandable=False` not disabling expansion. `Project.export` OR'd the master switch with `expandable_width`/`expandable_length`, which default to `True`, so every box was expandable and boxes declared fixed were silently stretched — Earth Animal Kingdom's `CanopyBox` was being grown 46 → 47mm and `SproutBox` 20.4 → 21.4mm against their declared sizes.
- [x] T182 Wire the per-axis expansion flags through to the solver: `expandable` alone gives the sub-3mm height absorb (FR-012), `expandable_width` adds the fill-to-fit width growth, in `pyboxbuilder/packing/layout.py`.
- [x] T183 Stop the packer from using the board's space. `Project.export` passed the full `game_box_size[2]` as the container height while the spacer pass used `height - board_thickness`, so auto-placed boxes could climb into the region reserved for the game board (FR-012, board-on-top).
- [x] T184 Raise `PackingError` instead of returning an empty packing. A solver failure was swallowed, so `export()` reported success having written no boxes at all. The message now names boxes taller than the container, or reports the fill ratio.
- [x] T185 [P] Write test: expansion respects the master switch, packing failures raise and explain themselves, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_packing.py` and `test_project_coverage.py`

**Checkpoint**: Declared-fixed boxes keep their size, nothing intrudes on the board space, and a layout that cannot be packed says so.

### Auto-packing Emberleaf — evaluated, not adopted

Emberleaf's 18 boxes fill **77%** of the usable volume (3296 cm³ of 4264 cm³ in 285 × 285 × 52.5mm). The original `.scad` layout achieves this because the box sizes were designed to tile exactly in three columns — 98 + 98 + 90 = 286 across, 142.5 × 2 = 285 deep, 13.125 × 4 = 52.5 tall.

The extreme-point First-Fit-Decreasing solver cannot find that arrangement. Measured: five sort strategies (footprint area, height, volume, height-then-volume, max dimension) all fail; twelve variants crossing those with three extreme-point orderings, best-fit selection and corner extreme-point generation all fail; 266,000 random permutations of the plain solver and 60,000 of the strongest variant produce no successful packing. The failure is in the placement rule, not the ordering — greedy extreme-point placement fragments the space rather than aligning columns.

Emberleaf therefore keeps explicit positions. Note this is not a statement that a better solver could not do it — a layout demonstrably exists.

**Update (T187): a better solver does do it.** The guillotine packer finds a valid Emberleaf arrangement in 3,237 nodes, about 30ms. Emberleaf still keeps its declarative `arrange()` — that expresses intent, which a solver cannot — but auto-packing is no longer the reason.

- [x] T186 Declarative column/stack layout — see Phase 15.
- [x] T187 Stronger 3D packing for high-fill layouts — see Phase 17.

## Phase 14: Earth Animal Kingdom fidelity, and lid decoration

### Earth Animal Kingdom — matched to the original

The port had drifted from `examples/earth_animal_kingdom.scad` on nearly every dimension.

- [x] T188 Derive every dimension with the original's formula. Corrected: card box height 25.6 → **23.6** (36 cards at 0.6mm + 2), sprout box (76, 156, 20.4) → **(76, 158, 22.4)**, animal boxes (174, 156, 12.1) → **(174, 158, 12.5)**.
- [x] T189 Correct the animal box type: `MakeBoxWithSlipoverLid` is `BoxType.SLIPOVER`, not `FILAMENT_HINGE`, with its own 1.5mm wall and a 4mm foot.
- [x] T190 Add `foot` and `slip` to `SlipoverBoxBuilder` and build a sleeve that stops at the foot in `pyboxbuilder/box/types/slipover.py`.
- [x] T191 Replace the invented `Boards` box with the original's `SpacerBox` (174 × 158 × 21).
- [x] T192 Position all six boxes to match `BoxLayout()`, which the port had left to the packer.
- [x] T193 Reproduce the precomputed animal partition from `lib/animal_kingdom_items_layout.scad` verbatim — 26 slots in AnimalBox1, 30 in AnimalBox2, 56 in total across 37 species — replacing the `share_compartments` solver, which produced a different split.
- [x] T194 Add the access pan each animal box carries over its slots (`RoundedBoxAllSides` at half the token thickness).
- [x] T195 [P] Write test: dimensions, box types, layout positions, and that every slot fits its interior with no two overlapping, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_earth_animal_kingdom.py`

### Lid decoration (T161)

- [x] T196 Implement `pyboxbuilder/lid/decorate.py` — apply a `LidBuilder`'s pattern and label to any box type's lid, deriving the decoratable face from the lid's own bounding box so no type has to declare one.
- [x] T197 Wire decoration into `Project.export` per colour mode: mmu keeps the label as separate coloured inserts, single engraves it into the lid.
- [x] T198 Fix `build_label` never extruding its text (`pybosl2.text` returns a 2-D shape) and mis-anchoring its frame and hatching.
- [x] T199 Size label text by measurement instead of by character count. The old estimate put **102mm of text on a 100mm lid**; text is now set at a nominal size, measured, and scaled to the label area.
- [x] T200 Shrink a framed label's backing plate to hug its text, so a lid can carry both a frame and a through-hole pattern — a plate the size of the label area covered the pattern entirely.
- [x] T201 Fix the pattern leaving a skin: it was placed by assumption rather than by its bounding box, so the holes stopped 0.7mm short of the top face and nothing showed. Also trimmed to the label area so it cannot eat the border.
- [x] T202 Degrade a framed label to engraved text in single-colour mode. A frame is a colour feature, and keeping it lifted the text 0.4mm clear of the face so the engraving cut nothing at all.
- [x] T203 [P] Write test: label sizing stays inside the margin, mmu yields separate inserts, single engraves, patterns cut through, and a decorated lid differs between the two modes, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_lid_decorate.py`

**Checkpoint**: Lids carry their labels and patterns. A plain sliding lid goes from 8 vertices to 1631 with a framed label and hex pattern; the single-colour variant is engraved instead of raised.

### Known gaps
- [x] T162 `InsetBox`, `SlidingCatchBox`, `CapPathBox`, `SlipoverPathBox`, `CardLibraryBox` and `FilamentHingeBox` still return a plain plate from `build_lid`; only sliding, cap and slipover produce their real mating geometry.
- [x] T163 `HingeBox` knuckles are a placeholder — no matching lid knuckles and no pin channel, so the hinge does not yet articulate.
- [x] T173 *(resolved, and the original diagnosis was wrong.)* Irish Gauge yields four spacers where the plan calls for two, and I recorded the extra pair as a footprint L that polygon-path spacers would close. It is not: `spacer_3` and `spacer_4` share a Y span and form an L in the **x-z** plane — a vertical step above `CompanyBox2`. Fusing it would give one part whose upper arm floats, replacing two trays that each sit flat with a single overhanging one. Rectilinear merging now handles genuine footprint L/T/U shapes (T174–T180), and vertical steps stay separate by design (FR-014e), so Irish Gauge stays at four spacers and that is the correct answer.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (sliding box + compartments)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `project.export()` for a single box with 3 compartments
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. US1 → Single box with compartments (MVP)
3. US2 → All box types selectable
4. US9 → Lids decorated with labels, patterns, colors
5. US3 + US4 → Finger cutouts + auto-layout
6. US7 + US8 → Auto-sizing + spacers + 3MF export
7. US5 + US6 → Nested boxes + manual positioning
8. Each phase adds value without breaking previous phases

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done — parallel:
   - Developer A: US1 (box + compartments)
   - Developer B: US2 (all box types)
3. After US1+2 done — parallel:
   - Developer A: US9 (lid decoration)
   - Developer B: US3 + US4 (finger cutouts + auto-layout)
4. After US4+9 done — sequential:
   - Developer A: US7 (auto-sizing)
   - Developer B: US8 (export)
5. Finally: US5+6 (nested + manual), then Polish

## Phase 15: Declarative Layout (T186)

**Purpose**: Close the gap between hand-typed coordinates and free-form packing.

**Goal**: An insert states its *structure* — three columns, each a set of rows, each row a stack — and the coordinates fall out of the box sizes. Densely packed inserts (above the ~70% fill where the packer gives up) stop needing hand-maintained numbers.

**Independent Test**: Convert an example that had explicit positions and verify every derived position equals the coordinate it used to be given.

- [x] T204 Implement `pyboxbuilder/layout.py` — `columns`/`rows`/`stack` groups that nest freely, `measure` (sum along the group's axis, max on the others), and `arrange` (each child starts where the previous ended)
- [x] T205 Add `Project.arrange(layout, origin=...)` — resolve the tree, set every builder's position, and reject an arrangement that does not fit the game box
- [x] T206 Export `columns`/`rows`/`stack` from the package's public surface
- [x] T207 Convert `boxes/emberleaf/emberleaf.py` — 21 hand-typed coordinates replaced by one nested `columns(...)` expression
- [x] T208 Convert `boxes/earth_animal_kingdom/earth_animal_kingdom.py` to `columns(stack(...), stack(...), "CanopyBox")`
- [x] T209 [P] Write test: measurement and placement on each axis, nesting, gaps, duplicate and unknown-box errors, container-fit rejection, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_layout.py`
- [x] T210 [P] Write test: Emberleaf's derived positions equal the original's hand-typed coordinates

**Checkpoint**: Both converted examples pass their existing position assertions unchanged — the derived coordinates are identical to the ones they replaced, including the three spacers the packer finds in the leftover space.

### Hausdorff comparison — found while running the converted examples

- [x] T211 Fix `hausdorff_distance` reporting 0.0 for meshes that differ. Two causes, both of which alone make the exporter skip writing changed geometry:
  1. **Vertex-only sampling.** pymeshlab defaults to `samplevert` at `samplenum=8`. Every vertex of a 10x10x5 box lies exactly on a side face of a 10x10x6 one, so the measured distance was zero for boxes differing by 0.5mm. Now samples faces and edges too, at 10,000 samples.
  2. **One-sided measurement.** Hausdorff is the larger of the two directions and they are not equal — in that example A→B is 0.0 while B→A is 0.5. Both directions are now measured.
- [x] T212 [P] Write a deterministic test for the Hausdorff branch. It had been exercised only by accident: pymeshlab lives in the project venv, which reaches `sys.path` only once some unrelated test module imports `tests/venv_path.py`, so whether the branch ran at all depended on test ordering. The test now loads pymeshlab from the venv itself and skips only if it is genuinely absent.

---

## Phase 16: Real Mating Lid Geometry (T162, T163)

**Purpose**: Six box types returned a flat plate where their closure should be.

**Goal**: Every lidded type produces a lid that mates with its body — and the body carries the matching half of the same feature.

**Independent Test**: For each of the eleven lidded types, the closed lid and its body share no volume.

- [x] T213 Implement `pyboxbuilder/box/features.py` — the closure features, each returning both halves from one function so they cannot drift apart: `rabbet`, `sliding_track`, `sliding_catch`, `filament_hinge`, and the polygon-footprint `path_cap` / `path_sleeve`
- [x] T214 `InsetBox`: a ledge cut into the top rim and a plate that drops into it flush, so the box still stacks
- [x] T215 `SlidingCatchBox`: sliding grooves plus a detent — a bump on the lid dropping into a slightly larger dimple, so it clicks rather than jams
- [x] T216 `CardLibraryBox`: the same sliding channel with a heavier latch
- [x] T217 `CapPathBox` and `SlipoverPathBox`: cap and sleeve whose skirts follow a polygon footprint, falling back to the rectangular closure when no path is given
- [x] T218 `FilamentHingeBox` (T163): interleaved knuckles along the back edge bored for a filament pin, each leaf webbed to its own half
- [x] T219 Fix the hinge geometry so the two halves are genuinely separate parts. Three defects, each of which fuses lid to body: the lid's plate sat at the rim where the walls already were (1408mm³ of overlap); the pin axis was sunk into the back wall, burying the lid's knuckles in it (154mm³); and the lid's web stood 0.2mm proud of the closed lid.
- [x] T220 [P] Write test: no lid overlaps its body, for every lidded type; plus per-feature properties — the rabbet is flush, a groove never cuts through its wall, the catch dimple is larger than its bump, the hinge leaves never touch at 3/5/9 knuckles — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`
- [x] T221 `HingeBox` (T163): the same knuckle hinge with a printed pin. Its body already had knuckles but the lid was a bare plate, so nothing could turn — both halves now interleave on one pin axis.
- [x] T222 [P] Write test: the hinge lid reaches past the back wall, both halves meet the same pin axis, and the part of the lid over the box footprint is flush at the stated height — the barrel is allowed to stand proud behind the box, as real hinges do
- [x] T223 Regenerate the golden images for the changed inset, hinge and filament-hinge bodies

**Checkpoint**: All eleven lidded types close with **0.00mm³** of body/lid intersection, measured.

## Phase 17: A packer for densely-filled inserts (T187)

The extreme-point solver places boxes at corner points, which fragments the free space. Above roughly 70% fill it cannot find arrangements that demonstrably exist, and it has a second, quieter fault: it floats boxes. A box resting one corner on another counted as placed, so a "successful" packing could contain a tray suspended in mid-air.

Adding a support check to that solver is not the fix — measured, it made the Emberleaf search 3000x more expensive (132 nodes to 300,000+, 0.08s to 306s) and it still found nothing. The corner-point space is the wrong space to search.

`pyboxbuilder/packing/guillotine.py` searches free *regions* instead, and gets three properties the corner-point search cannot have:

- **Support is structural.** Space is only ever opened above a box's own top face, or above a layer flagged `full` — one that must be filled solid. No overhang is representable, so none has to be checked for.
- **Feasibility depends on region sizes alone.** Regions are disjoint, so their positions cannot affect what fits. The memo key is therefore position-free, which is what keeps the state count searchable.
- **Smallest region first.** Fail-first: the most constrained region has the fewest options. This is the single biggest lever — measured on Emberleaf, largest-region-first finds nothing in 1,000,000 nodes; smallest-region-first solves it in 3,237.

- [x] T224 Implement `pyboxbuilder/packing/guillotine.py` — region-based guillotine search with class deduplication (five identical player boxes cost no more than one), volume bounds, and a memo keyed on region sizes
- [x] T225 Add the layer cut. Cutting only at a placed box's own faces cannot express a box bridging two boxes below it, which is how real inserts stack; on random instances built by cutting a container up — so a packing is known to exist — that gap cost 6 of 20. The layer cut spans the whole region and marks the rest of that layer `full`, so a bridge always spans solid material. 20 of 20 after.
- [x] T226 Prefer the unrotated orientation on ties. A lone 100×80×40 box in a 300×200×80 container came back turned to 80×100×40 — legal, but it changes the printed part's orientation for nothing.
- [x] T227 Make the guillotine solver primary in `pack_boxes`, keeping the extreme-point solver as a fallback (it searches a different, non-guillotine space) and porting the FR-012 expansion passes across
- [x] T228 Make the fallback's legacy `compartments` import lazy and optional, so its absence raises `PackingError` like any other packing failure instead of an `ImportError`
- [x] T229 [P] Write test: every reported packing is validated as buildable — inside the container, no two boxes overlapping, every box fully supported — plus Emberleaf packs, 285mm is correctly refused, no-rotate is honoured, bridging works over a solid layer and not over a gap, and 20 instances known to tile exactly all solve, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_guillotine.py`

**Checkpoint**: Emberleaf's 18 boxes at 77% fill pack in **0.05s** through `pack_boxes`, fully supported and validated. Emberleaf keeps its declarative `arrange()`, which states intent a solver cannot infer.

---

## Phase 18: A closed box is the size it says it is

Found by comparing the Emberleaf player box against `examples/emberleaf.scad` directly — slicing both at matched heights and measuring, rather than eyeballing renders.

**A box's declared size is the outside of the CLOSED box.** That is the space the packer reserves, the space `arrange()` allots, and the space the spacers fill around. Seven of the eleven lidded types broke it, by building a full-size body and hanging the lid off the outside of it:

| type | declared | actually built |
|---|---|---|
| `cap`, `cap_path` | 100 × 80 × 40 | 104.4 × 84.4 × 42 |
| `slipover`, `slipover_path` | 100 × 80 × 40 | 103.2 × 83.2 × 42 |
| `magnetic` | 100 × 80 × 40 | 100 × 80 × 42 |
| `card_library` | 100 × 80 × 40 | 100 × 80 × 40.04 |
| `hinge` | 100 × 80 × 40 | 100 × 86.25 × 41 |

For Emberleaf this is not cosmetic. Each cap-lid player box declared 98 × 142.5 × 13.125 and actually measured **104.4 × 148.9 × 15.125**: five of them need 75.6mm of a 52.5mm column and are 6.4mm too wide for it. The insert could not have been assembled. The original's body measures 10.93mm tall against the port's 13.125 — `body_height = height - lid_thickness - m_piece_wiggle_room`, which is where the convention was read from.

The T220 tests missed it because "no lid overlaps its body" is satisfied perfectly by a lid sitting entirely outside the box.

- [x] T230 Add the shared closure metrics to `pyboxbuilder/box/features.py` — `cap_metrics`/`cap_body`/`cap_lid`, `slipover_metrics`, `path_body_metrics` — so a body and the lid that wraps it derive from one set of numbers and cannot drift
- [x] T231 `CapBox` / `CapPathBox`: body stops a lid thickness short and steps its top band in by the lid's wall thickness; the cap's outer face is the declared footprint and its top the declared height
- [x] T232 `SlipoverBox` / `SlipoverPathBox`: body inset all round and stopped short, sleeve back out to the declared outline; `foot` keeps the full footprint at the bottom for the sleeve to seat on
- [x] T233 `MagneticBox`: body stops a lid thickness short so the plate closes flush at the declared height
- [x] T234 `sliding_catch`: trim the lid's catch bump to the box envelope. It engages sideways in the groove, so losing its crown costs nothing, and leaving it proud made `card_library` 0.04mm too tall
- [x] T235 Fix `path_cap` / `path_sleeve`, which grew the declared outline outward (`offset_footprint` by a negative distance) instead of insetting the body
- [x] T236 [P] Write test: every closed box measures exactly its declared size **over its declared footprint**, and nothing but a hinge barrel has any material outside that footprint — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`. Measuring over the footprint is what makes the hinge expressible as a bounded exception rather than a blanket one.
- [x] T237 Regenerate the cap and magnetic goldens. Note they did **not** fail: the renders use `--viewall`, so a uniformly shorter box looks almost identical and the 2.31 / 1.68 measured difference sits under the 12.0 tolerance. Image goldens cannot police dimensions; T236 can.
- [x] T238 Give `boxes/earth/earth.py` the sys.path bootstrap every other example carries — without it it fails with a bare `No module named 'pybosl2'` unless the caller has already set the path up

**Checkpoint**: All 13 box types build a closed box exactly the size they were asked for. Emberleaf's player box body is **10.925mm** against the original's 10.93, closing to the declared 98 × 142.5 × 13.125. All six examples export.

### Remaining fidelity gaps (not defects, but not matched either)

Measured against the original, the player box still carries 72,813mm³ of material to the original's 63,815mm³. Three known causes, all cosmetic:

1. The original rounds the body's outer vertical corners and bottom edge (`rounding=` on the `cuboid`); the port's are square.
2. The pull-out recess is `RoundedBoxAllSides` in the original — a dish with a rounded bottom hulled up to a full-size flat top. The port cuts a straight-walled prism with rounded vertical corners only.
3. The marker grip notches are `cyl(d=13, rounding=6)` in the original — nearly a lens — against the port's plain cylinders, so the port's read as one fused blob rather than separate notches.

---

## Phase 19: Interactive preview — `Project.show()` (plan §Make vs. Interactive)

**Purpose**: `show()` exists but only unions bodies at their packed positions. The plan asks it to be a readable preview.

**Goal**: A viewer can tell one box from another, see through a lid, look under a layer, and see the spacers that fill the dead space.

**Independent Test**: Show a 4-box project with `remove_layers=1` and verify the top layer's boxes are absent from the rendered solid while every lower box is present.

- [x] T239a Stop `show()` unioning the bodies — build a list of independently placed, independently coloured solids and show each, so per-box colour, lid translucency and spacer grey survive and touching boxes do not fuse into one blob, in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`
- [x] T239 Add `remove_layers: int = 0` to `Project.show()` — omit the top N vertical layers of the packed layout (a box is in a removed layer when its top surface sits above the N-th slice), revealing what is underneath, in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`
- [x] T240 [P] Assign each box a stable colour for preview: its own body colour when set, otherwise a deterministic pseudo-random hue hashed from its label. View-time only — it must not reach the exported geometry or its material, in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`
- [x] T241 [P] Render spacer placements in `show()` too, always in a variant of grey drawn from outside the per-box palette, so dead fill is instantly distinguishable from a real box
- [x] T242 [P] Render a shown lid semi-transparent (50% alpha) in a slightly lighter shade of its box's colour, so the lid reads as a separate piece and the box stays visible through it
- [x] T243 [P] Write test: `remove_layers` drops exactly the boxes above each slice (0 → all, N → none of the top layer), colours are stable across runs and unique per label, spacers are grey and lids lighter-and-transparent, and `show()` writes no files, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_show.py`

**Checkpoint**: `project.show()` is a usable layout preview, not a monolithic union.

---

## Phase 20: Curve precision — `fn` / `fa` / `fs` (plan §Curve precision)

**Purpose**: Every curve currently renders at whatever default the call site happened to get; nothing is overridable.

**Goal**: One precision setting on `export()`/`show()` reaches every curved feature, and no geometry call hardcodes a facet count the caller cannot override.

**Independent Test**: Export the same box at `fn=8` and `fn=64` and verify the cylinder-derived features change facet count while the box's measured bounding box does not.

- [x] T244 Add optional `fn`, `fa`, `fs` parameters to `Project.export()` and `Project.show()` and thread them through a single render-context object rather than a parameter on every call, in `pyboxbuilder/project.py`
- [x] T245 Consume the context in every geometry call that renders a curve — cylinders/spheres, `cuboid(rounding=)`, fillets and chamfers, finger-scoop and finger-hole profiles, hex and tessellation edges, and lid-pattern curves — in `pyboxbuilder/box/`, `pyboxbuilder/compartments/`, `pyboxbuilder/lid/`
- [x] T246 [P] Write test: defaults are `fa=12, fs=2`; an explicit `fn` reaches a scoop, a hex cell and a lid pattern; and no module hardcodes a facet count (grep-style assertion over `pyboxbuilder/`), in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_precision.py`

**Checkpoint**: Precision is one knob, from fast preview to print quality.

---

## Phase 21: Edge smoothing and silhouette fidelity (FR-043, FR-044, FR-045)

**Purpose**: The plan requires that nothing a finger or a card touches be a sharp 90° edge — but no box body is rounded today and `rounding` exists only inside `compartments/carve.py`.

**Goal**: Structural edges are filleted at a configurable small radius; piece silhouettes are untouched.

**Independent Test**: Slice a box body at its top rim and at the wall/floor junction and verify a filleted profile at both, then verify an SVG element's outline is vertex-for-vertex what was parsed.

- [x] T247 Add a configurable `rounding` to `Project` and `BoxBuilder`, defaulting to **`wall_thickness / 2`** (FR-044), and round every body's outer vertical corners and bottom edges in `pyboxbuilder/box/shell.py` (FR-043d)
- [x] T247a Add `pyboxbuilder/rounding.py`. Rounding is applied by **subtracting the corner slivers**, not by intersecting with a rounded envelope: the two agree on an ordinary box, but the intersection also trims anything reaching outside the declared envelope, and a hinge barrel legitimately does. Subtracting only what the rounding removes also leaves the flat faces alone, so a rounded box still measures exactly its declared size (Phase 18).
- [x] T247b Round the top edges only where nothing mates there — directly on a lidless body's free rim, and on the **lid** for the eleven lidded types, so the closed box presents a rounded top without a rounded sealing face
- [x] T247c Fillet the internal wall/floor junction by rounding the bottom edges of the subtracted void. Deliberately **not** the void's vertical corners: those fillets run the full height, including the band where a sliding lid seats, and measured they put 0.59mm³ of body inside the lid on all three sliding types (FR-044a)
- [x] T247e Fix `vertical_edges`: `Anchor.Z` is an *axis* anchor that the edge language resolves to a **single** edge, so every box rounded "on its vertical corners" had one corner rounded and three square (FR-044d). Uses the four two-face anchors instead. The same mistake was live at both compartment-well call sites (`carve.py`, `element.py`).
- [x] T247f Add a 48-facet floor for edge fillets. At the default `fs = 2mm` a 1mm roundover gets one segment and comes out a **chamfer**; and since a fillet is an inscribed polygon, too few facets also pull its face in by the sagitta — 0.029mm at 16 facets against 0.003mm at 48, which is what sets the number (SC-030).
- [x] T247g State the faceting tolerance where tests assert declared sizes, rather than asserting exact equality a faceted fillet cannot deliver, in `test_carve.py`, `test_exporter.py`, `test_rounding.py`
- [x] T247h Round a **partial lid's grip on both halves at a smaller shared radius** (FR-044b): `inner_rounding`, half the outer radius by default, on the cap's band and its skirt cavity and on the slipover's body and sleeve cavity, so the two nest. The interior cavity keeps square vertical edges (FR-044c).
- [x] T247j Fix the face fillet, which was a **cove and not a roundover** (FR-044e). `sqrt(r² - d²)` is tangent to the cut's own wall and meets the face at 90°, so it gouged a groove in a ring around every scoop and finger hole instead of softening the edge. The roundover is its mirror image, `r - sqrt(r² - (r - d)²)`, tangent to the face — the two are indistinguishable in a parameter list, which is how it shipped.
- [x] T247k Make the buildable-radius guard edge-aware (`rounding.max_radius`). The blanket `radius < min(size) / 2` rejected an 8mm floor fillet in a 12mm-deep tray, which is buildable — a fillet is constrained by the dimensions *perpendicular* to its edge, halved only where the opposite edge is rounded too.
- [x] T247l Round **tray wells** on their vertical corners and their floor at `depth × 2/3` (FR-044f), sized off the cutout rather than the box: a deep well needs a big sweep and a shallow token tray a small one. Zero for anything the game dictates — card slots, SVG silhouettes, element packs (FR-044g), which is FR-045's principle applied to rounding.
- [x] T247m Split curve precision between export and preview (FR-046): `export()` defaults to `EXPORT_FN = 256` because that geometry gets printed; `show()` stays on `fa`/`fs` so a preview is responsive. Measured cost: Irish Gauge's 32 files take ~90s at 256 against a few seconds at the default.
- [x] T247m1 Keep print quality out of CI (FR-046a). A CI pass is not a build: the export tests check which files are written, skipped, cached and deleted, none of which depends on tessellation. `PYBOXBUILDER_EXPORT_FN` runs them coarse — the suite went from over five minutes back to ~65s — and the workflow sets it, writes only to temp dirs, and produces no printable output. The library's own default is untouched.
- [x] T247o Fix the tray floor fillet silently dropping out: `build_compartment_well` still used the blunt `min(w, l, d) / 2` guard, so an 8mm radius in a 12mm-deep well failed it and the well came back with rounded corners and a **square floor** — corners alone leave the piece in a square trough. Now uses `max_radius`; measured 2186mm³ more removed.
- [x] T247p Flip compartment rounding to **opt-in** (FR-044f): square by default, `holds_pieces` marks a tray. Most wells are shaped by what they hold, so softening them changes a fit rather than improving it. Emberleaf's card boxes need no change under this default — they never declared rounding, so they are 0.
- [x] T247q Make `preview_pieces()` public and give CI its geometry coverage there instead of from export (FR-046b): it packs the layout and builds every body, lid and spacer with no file, no render binary and no print precision. All twelve examples build in ~10s.
- [x] T247s Rebuild the **edge scoop** as a two-radius profile (FR-043a): flat top, **r1** rolling the top face into the wall, straight throat, **r2** into a **flat bottom**. Replaces the smoothstep mouth, which was vertical at *both* ends — it matched the throat and then arrived at the rim vertical too, leaving exactly the hard edge against the flat top face it was meant to remove.
- [x] T247t Guarantee a flat run at the base: r2 is capped at 3/4 of the throat half-width, because a fillet grown to the full half-width closes the flat into the U-shaped trough the flat bottom exists to avoid.
- [x] T247u Separate the **floor finger hole** from the edge scoop (FR-043a1). They were built from one profile, which put a flat-bottomed pan where a bowl belongs: a floor hole is a bore a piece is pushed *up* through, so its bottom stays tangent to the floor. `floor_bore_profile` is its own shape; `_sweep_through_wall` keeps the genuinely shared half (depth matching, face fillets, floor clip, side placement).
- [x] T247w Stop `r1` being silently zeroed (FR-043a3). The throat was capped to half the span first and `r1` given the remainder, so any scoop already at half the span lost its top roll entirely — the most visible part of the cut, gone on exactly the narrow compartments that need it most. The two now shrink together.
- [x] T247x Derive every scoop default from the cut instead of a constant (FR-043a2): `r1` and `r2` from the throat width, a finger hole's height from its radius. The 6mm default height came from the original's `depth_of_hole` — its *wall* depth, a different quantity — and made every hole a shallow nick regardless of the finger it was cut for.
- [x] T247y Hang exterior finger holes from the top of the **interior**, not the rim (FR-043b1). On a lidded box the lid band sits above the interior, so a rim-aligned hole started in solid material. Cap and slipover pass their own `interior_top`, since their bodies are already shortened and would otherwise take the allowance twice (FR-043b2).
- [x] T247z Give the sliding box an **open end** (FR-002a). It cut two grooves and left both end walls solid — a lid that can be dropped in but never slid, which is the one thing the type is for. One subtraction now makes the grooves and the opening, since they are the same slot; the far wall stays as the stop, and the lid fills the channel flush.
- [x] T247ab Make the face fillet **follow the cut's outline** (FR-044e1). It was ramping straight from the bottom of the scoop to the top: the hand-rolled sweep chained convex hulls between offset slices, and the convex hull of a U-shaped outline fills the U in. Convexity is the assumption to watch — every hull-based smoothing carries it silently, and a scoop is exactly the shape that fails it.
- [x] T247ac Use pybosl2's own `Path2D.offset_sweep` (BOSL2's `offset_sweep` with `os_circle`) instead of the hand-rolled stand-in, and keep the profile as a **point ring** so the sweep has an outline to follow. Deleted `pyboxbuilder/sweep.py`.
- [x] T247ad Continue the outline `RIM_OVERSHOOT_MM` above the rim. Closing it flush across the top puts a zero-angle cusp at each end of the r1 arc, and offsetting a cusp miters to infinity — measured, a ±15mm profile came back ±55mm. Where material sits above the interior (a lid band, a sliding track) the overshoot is trimmed back so the cut cannot carve through it.
- [x] T247af Fix the face fillet a **third** time, now that it follows the outline: `os_circle` was still the wrong rim profile. Its arc is tangent to the cut's *wall* and meets the end face at 90°, so on a subtractive solid it hollowed a cove **inside** the wall and left the opening at nominal width — a cutout. The roundover is the mirrored arc, tangent to the **face** (`z = r(1-cos a)`, `inset = r sin a`), supplied as an `os_profile`, with the widened outline as the path because `offset_sweep`'s path is the cross-section *at the end face*.
- [x] T247ag [P] Write the measurement that separates a roundover from a cove, since renders do not: the cut must be **wider at the face than mid-wall** (45.9mm vs 42.0mm on a 4mm wall with a 2mm fillet), by about the fillet radius each side, and equal when the fillet is off — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T247ai Run a **compartment** scoop from the well floor to the box's **top face** (FR-043b3), not to the interior ceiling. The ceiling is where the well stops, not the wall: a lidded box's lid band stood above the cut as a step, with the r1 roll buried inside the wall. This was the step visible on both sides of Emberleaf's card box.
- [x] T247aj Default a scoop to the **shorter** wall (FR-043b4). Emberleaf's card boxes had theirs in the 98mm face; a card stack is lifted out across its narrow dimension, so it belongs in the 73mm one. `scoop_side` now stays `None` until resolved, so the default can apply.
- [x] T247ak Cap the floor dip at a small constant (FR-043b5). Sized as a share of the floor it reached 1mm — half of Emberleaf's 2mm floor — and showed as the cut eating into it. Its only job is to keep the cut's bottom face off the floor plane.
- [x] T247al Slide the lid out through the box's **shorter** face (FR-002b): grooves in the long walls, opening at the narrow end. The channel is computed once as though sliding along X and the axes swapped when it is not.
- [x] T247am Solve the arc join as the circles' **common tangent** (FR-043a4) rather than assuming it is vertical. Same geometry for the current placement, but no longer dependent on it. The tangent wanted is an **internal** one — the arcs curve opposite ways — and filtering for "outside both circles", the natural first guess, picks an external tangent and throws the profile 12mm wide.
- [x] T247ao Model wall tops **per side** (FR-043b7/b8). The four walls need not end level — a sliding box's channel runs out through its exit wall, so that wall stops a lid thickness short — and a scoop aligned to one box-wide "top" is then built at the wrong height, silently. `box/base.wall_tops` returns `{side: z}` with a per-type hook; the map rides on the spec so exterior holes and compartment scoops read the same numbers.
- [x] T247ap Put the finger scoop in the wall the lid leaves by on the sliding family, and round only that lid's exit end (FR-043b6, FR-044h/i). Lid radius capped at half the lid's thickness, since a thin plate's edges are what hold it.
- [x] T247aq Open the shared `sliding_track` channel. `SlidingCatchBox` and `CardLibraryBox` had the same blocked-end defect `SlidingBox` had — FR-002a was only half implemented.
- [x] T247ar *(superseded by T247au — I had read "the scoop" as the wall cut; it meant the pull-out recesses inside compartments.)* Setting `r1` to the scoop's depth made the cut far too wide, since `r1` sets the mouth width as well as the curve.
- [x] T247au Split the top roll into an **ellipse**: flare sets the mouth width, rise sets how gently the top turns (FR-043c3). Only the vertical extents compete for the wall's height, so a shallow wall keeps the full width and loses only curve — which is what the player card box needed, having lost its top curve entirely when the two were tied together.
- [x] T247av Widen the floor fillet to 0.65 of the throat half-width. It sits inside the throat, so it costs no width.
- [x] T247aw Give every **silhouette slot** a finger pull-out (FR-043c1/c2): a dish across the slot at half the piece's depth, rounded on every edge so a finger slides in from the surrounding floor. A slot cut to a piece's outline holds it exactly, which is what leaves nowhere to get a fingertip — the pull-out is part of the slot, not an extra. Per-slot depth, width, and opt-out.
- [x] T247ax Move the hinge **inside** the box's outline (FR-002c): the pin axis sits inside the back wall and is sunk so the barrel's crown is flush with the closed box's top. Phase 18 had recorded the protruding barrel as the one allowed exception to "a closed box is the size it declares" — but a box with a barrel hanging off it cannot be packed against its neighbours, and nothing tells the packer to reserve the room. Both hinged types now measure exactly their declared size in all three axes.
- [x] T247ay Relieve **each half out of the other** (FR-002e). Inside the box, the lid's knuckles occupy space the body's wall fills and the body's knuckles occupy space the lid's plate fills. `Closure` gained `body_cut` and `lid_cut`. Doing one side only is worse than a trap: the obvious symptom disappears while the other half stays welded — which is exactly what the first attempt produced.
- [x] T247az Carve the hinge out of the **interior mask** (FR-002d), following the original's `FilamentBoxInsideMask`. `interior_mask` is a per-type hook returning `None` for every type whose interior is simply its interior; the hinge types return the interior less the hinge's intrusion. `build_contents` clips the wells to it and leaves finger scoops alone, since breaching a wall is a scoop's job.
- [x] T247bb Give a **slipover sleeve corner finger notches** (FR-002f). A sleeve is otherwise a smooth box with nothing to grip; the original cuts two **diagonally opposite** corners just under the lid plate, so a pair of fingers pulls along its axis rather than twisting it.
- [x] T247bc Build the notch from the **same scoop** as every other finger cut (FR-002g). The original's `CornerCatch` is two `FingerHoleWall` scoops meeting at a corner, so `features.corner_catch` composes two `build_wall_scoop`s the same way — it inherits the roll, the floor fillet and the face fillets rather than reimplementing them.
- [x] T247bd Size it as the original does (FR-002h): half the skirt's height capped at 20mm, radius at least 7mm so a shallow sleeve still admits a fingertip, and both settable.
- [x] T247be Trim the notch at the lid plate. The scoop outline overshoots its rim by design — that is what stops a cut leaving a skin — but here there *is* material above it, so the overshoot was carving 1.5mm into the plate.
- [x] T247bf Fix `slipover_finger_height=0` being read as "unset". `spec.get(...) or default` treats zero as missing, so asking for no notch produced the default one — which also made the first version of the test compare a notched sleeve against itself and pass nothing.
- [x] T247bg [P] Write test: the notches remove material, leave the declared footprint alone, sit at the two diagonal corners and **not** at the other two, stay below the lid plate, survive a shallow sleeve, and follow the settable height — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`
- [x] T247ba [P] Write test: a hinged box is its declared size in every axis with the halves still separate; both reliefs exist; the mask is smaller than the whole interior for hinged types and `None` for the rest; and a well in a hinged box comes out smaller than the same well unmasked — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`. The old tests asserting the barrel *must* protrude were rewritten rather than deleted, since the property they guarded (the hinge is at the back, the lid reaches the pin) still matters.
- [x] T247as [P] Write test: per-side tops for lidless/sliding/cap and the spec-carried map; the sliding scoop's exit-wall rule beating the shape rule; a sliding lid rounding 3 edges against a cap lid's 8; the lid radius capped by thickness; and the pull-out roll filling the cut's height — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [ ] T247at Blend a compartment scoop into a **flat neighbour**. Where a scoop's mouth opens onto an adjacent compartment's floor or the top of a divider rather than onto a wall, it should continue its roll across that surface instead of stopping at an edge. Needs the carve pass to know what is beside each compartment — wells are built independently today — so the work is: give the layout a notion of neighbours, then let a scoop opening onto a flat area carry its roll into it.
- [x] T247an [P] Write test: the tangent solver finds the throat and picks the internal tangent, a wide compartment cuts its short wall while an explicit side still wins, a long box slides along its length, and the floor dip stays 0.2mm whatever the floor — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T247ah Make the scoop outline's arc sampling follow the curve precision. It was pinned at 16 segments, so an export tessellated every other curve finely and these coarsely — the exact thing T245 exists to prevent. 72 points at the default, 264 at `fn=256`.
- [x] T247ae [P] Write test: the outline overshoots the rim and stays symmetric; the floor bore's outline is a bowl rather than a flat pan; and a lidded box's finger hole tops out at its interior (38 on a 40mm box with a 2mm lid) while a lidless one reaches the rim — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T247aa [P] Write test: r1 scales with the throat and survives a narrow span, a finger hole's height follows its radius, one bare `finger_hole(side)` call cuts a real scoop on no-lid/sliding/cap/slipover, and a lidded box's hole stops below the rim — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T247v [P] Write test: both radii change the profile independently, r2 defaults to half the throat half-width and is capped so the flat survives, radii scale down to fit a shallow scoop, and the floor bore is a different shape from the edge profile — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T247r [P] Write test: every example project under `boxes/` builds through the preview path and writes no files, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_ci_smoke.py`; and the tray tests assert the opt-in default, both radii, and that silhouettes stay square even when declared.
- [x] T247n [P] Write test: the tray radius is `depth × 2/3` and scales with the well not the box, is capped by the footprint, and is zero for cards/silhouettes/element packs; `max_radius` allows a lone bottom fillet the full depth but halves it against an opposing face; and `export` builds at 256 while `show` does not — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_rounding.py`
- [x] T247i [P] Write test: the vertical selector resolves to four edges and `Anchor.Z` to one; a fillet gets at least 32 facets; the mating radius is half the outer one, overridable per project and per box; and no rounded body intrudes into its lid across all eight lidded types including the partial ones — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_rounding.py`
- [x] T247d [P] Write test: the default is wall/2 and is overridable per project and per box; rounding removes material, preserves the declared envelope exactly, rounds a lidless rim as well, and leaves every lidded type's body/lid intersection at zero — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_rounding.py`
- [x] T248 Rebuild the finger scoops from the original's `FingerHoleWall` / `FingerHoleBase`, in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/finger_hole.py` (FR-043). They were a bare cylinder and a bare sphere — no rounding of any kind, and the cylinder ran 1mm *below* the floor. Now a swept 2-D profile with all three of the original's roundings: a mouth flared into the rim, a `-os_circle` fillet onto each wall face, and a bore tangent to the floor. Includes the original's tangent-blend branch (`circle_circle_tangents`) for scoops too shallow for a straight throat.
- [x] T248a Add `pyboxbuilder/sweep.py` — `offset_sweep`, the CSG stand-in for BOSL2's `offset_sweep(..., os_circle(±r))`, with the same sign convention (positive convex roundover, negative concave flare). Rim arcs are a **chained hull** of offset slices rather than stacked prisms, which left a visible eight-step staircase across the fillet.
- [x] T248b Match the sweep to the wall exactly (`wall_thickness + 0.03`, centred). Overshooting by 1mm each side — the obvious way to guarantee a clean boolean — put both face fillets outside the box and failed to pierce any wall thicker than the overshoot.
- [x] T248c Stop the cut a controlled distance *below* the well floor instead of flush with it. Flush leaves a face coplanar with the floor, which renders as speckle; the dip is 0.2mm by default, or half a known floor capped at 1mm, and is a limit on the flare rather than an unconditional offset.
- [x] T248d Fix `_SIDE_SPIN`: LEFT and RIGHT were inverted, so those scoops cut *into* the compartment and shaved the wall's inner face by 0.015mm, piercing nothing. Bounding boxes are identical either way, which is how it survived — the measured test now asserts the cut lies outside the compartment footprint.
- [x] T248e Wire exterior finger holes (FR-006's third case), which were a declared-but-dead `finger_holes` field: `BoxBuilder.finger_hole()`, a typed `FingerHoleBuilder.side: ScoopSide`, and `shell.apply_finger_holes` cutting them through the same scoop builder so they cannot drift from the compartment version.
- [x] T248g Make the mouth an **S-curve** (FR-043a): a `3t² - 2t³` smoothstep sampled as a polygon, replacing the quarter-arc. An arc matches tangents at both ends but jumps in curvature at each, which shows as a crease where the flat top starts to fall away and again where the fillet meets the throat; the smoothstep has zero curvature at both ends, so the top of the box flows into the scoop and back out with no line anywhere. It also deletes a special case — the original needs a `circle_circle_tangents` blend when a scoop is too shallow for an arc, whereas a sampled S just gets shorter.
- [x] T248h [P] Write test: the S runs throat-to-top, widens monotonically (no undercut), is flat at both ends and steepest in the middle, reverses curvature exactly once, and a shallow scoop keeps half its height as throat — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T248f [P] Write test: measured in the app — the cut pierces the full wall at 2/3/5mm, dips only its permitted amount into the floor, hangs from the rim for exterior holes, every side cuts outward through its own wall, and each rounding widens the cut by the stated amount, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [ ] T249 Sliding boxes: apply the chamfer/rounding to the **lower** lid-track wall, not the higher one, so it cannot foul the dovetail. Rotate the lid section to the opposite side when that puts the smooth edge on the non-track side, and skip the rotation when the box's length/width ratio makes it wasteful (a long narrow card box), in `pyboxbuilder/box/types/sliding.py` + `box/features.py`
- [ ] T250 [P] Fillet the remaining touched edges — each **compartment well's** own top rim and wall/floor junction — at the same configurable radius, in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/carve.py`. (The *box's* wall/floor junction and the finger-scoop profile are done, in T247c and T248 respectively; a compartmented box is carved by its wells rather than hollowed, so those wells need the same treatment.)
- [ ] T251 [P] Enforce silhouette fidelity (FR-045): no smoothing/rounding pass may run over `CompartmentElement` shape geometry or a parsed SVG path, even where the outline is hard to print, in `pyboxbuilder/compartments/element.py`
- [ ] T252 [P] Write test: body rim/corner/base edges are filleted at the configured radius and the radius is overridable; the card scoop is continuous from rim to floor and does not breach the floor; the sliding chamfer lands on the low track wall; an SVG element's outline is unchanged by any smoothing setting — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_smoothing.py`
- [ ] T253 Regenerate the golden images the rounded bodies change, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/golden/`

**Checkpoint**: Nothing a hand touches is a sharp edge, and nothing a piece defines has been softened.

## Phase 22: Validation, errors and warnings (plan §Validation)

**Purpose**: `pyboxbuilder` raises 16 `ValueError`s and emits **zero** warnings; the spec's edge-case table asks for both.

**Goal**: Every rejected configuration names its offender, and every degraded-but-legal configuration says so without stopping the export.

**Independent Test**: Run the table — each error row raises with the offender named, each warning row completes the export and emits exactly one warning.

- [ ] T254 Add `pyboxbuilder/errors.py` — `PackingError` plus a single `warn()` helper (stdlib `warnings`, project-specific category) so warnings are filterable and testable with `assertWarns`
- [ ] T255 Implement the missing rejections: hex grid `rows`/`cols` ≤ 0; a hex tile leaving zero cells fitting the interior; a magnet slot count exceeding the available straight-wall length (slots must never cross a corner, FR-039); a spacer whose computed height is ≤ 0; a box with neither compartments nor an explicit `size` — each naming the box/compartment and the offending value
- [ ] T256 Implement the missing warnings: `LidBuilder` set on a lidless box type (warn + drop the decoration); an empty exported mesh (warn + do **not** write the file); body colour equal to all three accent colours (warn — degenerates to one material); overlapping finger cutouts; and an empty project returning an empty `ExportResult` with no PDF and no error
- [ ] T257 Confirm the documented non-errors stay non-errors: `expandable=True` on a standalone box is ignored silently, a corrupt `.layout_cache.json` is a cache miss, and zero-thickness walls between adjacent compartments merge into one cavity
- [ ] T258 [P] Write test: one case per row of both tables in the plan's *Validation, Errors and Warnings*, asserting the exact message for errors and `assertWarns` for warnings, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_validation.py`

**Checkpoint**: Invalid input is rejected with an explanation; degraded input is flagged and still builds.

---

## Phase 23: Typed options — no bare strings (plan §Typed Options)

**Purpose**: `BoxBuilder.stackable` and `.magnet_type` are `str | None`, which the constitution's "enums for all type selections, no bare strings" forbids.

**Independent Test**: A bare string in either field is a type error under pyright and a `TypeError` at runtime.

- [x] T259 Add `StackableMode` (`INSIDE`, `OUTSIDE`) and `MagnetType` (`ROUND`, `RECT`, `NONE`) to `pyboxbuilder/enums.py`, and give `ScoopSide` a real default member instead of `None`
- [x] T260 Migrate `BoxBuilder`, `box/types/no_lid.py`, the registry and all six example projects that set them; reject a bare string at construction rather than coercing it
- [x] T261 [P] Write test: enum members round-trip through builder → box type → geometry, a bare string raises, and `boxes/stackable_hexes` still produces its 8 variants unchanged, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_enums.py`

---

## Phase 24: Documentation, dual-run examples, and traceability

**Purpose**: Three standing policies in the plan have no task: the docstring rules, the run-in-both-environments rule for examples, and the coverage map.

**Independent Test**: Every `boxes/*` project both imports cleanly (building its `Project`, writing nothing) and exports when run as `__main__` with `FROM_MAKE=1`.

- [ ] T262 Audit every public class/method/function/enum/dataclass field in `pyboxbuilder/` against the plan's *Documentation Policy* — mandatory `Args:`/`Returns:` sections, documented dataclass fields, no one-liners on public API — and fill the gaps
- [ ] T263 [P] Add a docs check to `.github/workflows/docs.yml` that fails the build on a public symbol with no docstring or a missing `Args:`/`Returns:` section, so `pdoc pyboxbuilder` cannot silently drift from the policy
- [ ] T264 [P] Write test: every project under `boxes/` imports without `__file__`, builds its `Project` without exporting, and exports under `FROM_MAKE=1` — parameterised over the directory listing so a new example is covered the day it lands, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_examples_dual_run.py`
- [ ] T265 [P] Give the five undocumented examples (`arkham_horror`, `dominion`, `first_class`, `magical_athlete`, `nippon`) a README each stating the game box size and what the port demonstrates, matching `boxes/earth_animal_kingdom/README.md`
- [ ] T266 [P] Write test: the plan's *Requirements Coverage Map* stays honest — every SC row names a test module that exists, in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_coverage_map.py`

**Checkpoint**: The policies the plan states are enforced by CI rather than by memory.

---

## Phase 25: Angled dovetail sliding lid (FR-002c–FR-002f)

**Purpose**: The sliding lid's grooves were square slots. The spec asks for an angled dovetail and a configurable slide clearance.

**Goal**: The sliding lid is dovetailed on both long edges — **the box interior at the top (width − 2 × wall thickness), reaching half the wall width into each wall at the bottom** — with the matching groove in each wall that leaves half the wall behind it for support, so the lid cannot be lifted out, plus a slight chamfer on its leading end and a configurable clearance (default 0.1mm) so it slides smoothly. (This phase also dovetailed **the back**, making the lid a frustum trapped on all three closed sides; Phase 26 reverted that as a wedge catch.)

**Independent Test**: `sliding_dovetail(SPEC) == (0, wall_width / 2)`, the lid's top face is the interior while its underside reaches half a wall into each side, wall material is left behind the groove, and the lid-to-groove clearance is configurable. (The back dovetail this phase also added was reverted in Phase 26 — it is a wedge catch.)

- [x] T267 [P] [US2] Write test: the dovetail has no key at the top (interior) and half a wall at the bottom, the lid's top face is the interior and its underside flares out by one wall width, the leading end is chamfered, the groove is wider at its floor than its opening but never reaches the outer face, and the lead chamfer is half the lid thickness — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`
- [x] T268 [US2] Implement `sliding_dovetail`, `lead_chamfer_size`, the frustum builder and the leading-end chamfer, and rewrite `sliding_track` as a dovetail in `pyboxbuilder/box/features.py`; route `SlidingBox` through the shared `dovetail_track` with its axis-swap in `pyboxbuilder/box/types/sliding.py`. `SlidingCatchBox` and `CardLibraryBox` share `sliding_track`, so they carry the same profile.
- [x] T271 [US2] Correct the dovetail profile. The first pass was wide at the top (let the lid lift out); a later pass cut the key through to the outer face (no wall behind the groove); another made the flank too steep. The settled profile is **interior at the top, half the wall width at the bottom**, so the groove traps the lid and half the wall stays behind it for support.
- [x] T272 [P] [US2] Write test: the back is dovetailed exactly like the sides (stop wall full thickness at the top, half thickness at the bottom), the lid's leading end seats there, and `sliding_slack` (clearance, default 0.1mm) is configurable. **The first two assertions were replaced in Phase 26** by their opposite (SC-048); the clearance one stands — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`
- [x] T273 [US2] Make the back dovetailed like the sides and the clearance configurable in `dovetail_track` (`pyboxbuilder/box/features.py`, FR-002e, FR-002f): the lid and channel are now frustums dovetailed on both flanks and the back, straight at the front, cut short by `sliding_slack` on every face and never reaching the outer wall. **The back dovetail was reverted in Phase 26** — it is a wedge catch, and the clearance half of this task is what survives.
- [ ] T270 [US2] Regenerate the `sliding_body` golden image in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/golden/`. Deferred — this machine's PythonSCAD render differs from the committed goldens (every box render comes out ~15% larger, including unchanged types), so a clean single-image regeneration is not possible here; do it in the canonical render environment.

**Checkpoint**: All three sliding types still close with 0.00mm³ of body/lid intersection, and their lids now carry the retaining angled dovetail with wall material behind the groove and a configurable slide clearance.

---

## Phase 26: No wedge catch on a sliding lid — a bump instead (FR-002e1–e3)

**Purpose**: T273 dovetailed the **back** of the channel as well as the sides, so the lid's leading end seated under a lip on the stop wall. That is a wedge catch: the lid has to be driven under the overhang to close and sprung back out to open, and the part doing the flexing is the thinnest section of a printed part at the end of the longest lever. The emberleaf player card box showed it plainly.

**Goal**: A sliding box that needs holding shut gets a **bump and dimple** detent at the outlet, never a wedge. (This phase also squared off both ends of the channel; Phase 27 put the back seat back — it was never the wedge.)

**Independent Test**: The channel and the lid are the same length at the channel floor as at the channel opening (no taper along the slide axis); a catch, when asked for, puts a dimple in the wall beside the outlet and a larger-than-the-bump matching bump on the lid.

- [x] T274 [P] [US2] Write test: the channel's and the lid's closed end sits at the **same** coordinate along the slide axis when sliced at the channel floor and at the channel opening (SC-048), and the lid's leading face is square — replacing the two tests that asserted the back taper — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`. **Reversed in Phase 27**: the back taper is a seat and the tests asserting it were restored.
- [x] T275 [US2] Remove the back dovetail from `dovetail_track` in `pyboxbuilder/box/features.py`: the along-axis extent is the same at both faces and the shift is zero, so only the across-axis flanks taper. The stop wall keeps full thickness; the lid's leading face becomes square and its lead chamfer moves with it. **Reversed in T280** — the seat belongs at the back; what had to go was the *catch* working by deformation, which T276–T279 replaced with the bump.
- [x] T276 [US2] Make `sliding_catch` **slide-axis aware** (FR-002e2) in `pyboxbuilder/box/features.py`. It was hardcoded to X and placed off the raw `width`, so on a box sliding along Y it landed on the wrong pair of walls. It now takes the same `along_axis` as `dovetail_track` and positions from the **outlet** face.
- [x] T277 [US2] Centre the bump on the lid's dovetail **flank at mid-thickness** rather than on the wall's inner face. The old placement put the sphere's centre 0.4mm outside the lid edge, so the "bump on the lid" was mostly hanging in air beside it.
- [x] T278 [US2] Let a plain `SlidingBox` opt into a catch via `catch_radius` (FR-002e3), defaulting to **none** — the original toolkit's sliding box has no catch, and making it default-on would leave `SLIDING` and `SLIDING_CATCH` the same type. `SlidingCatchBox` and `CardLibraryBox` keep theirs always on, now on the correct axis.
- [x] T279 [P] [US2] Write test: a plain sliding box has no catch and gains one from `catch_radius`; the dimple and bump both lie within a wall thickness plus two bump radii of the outlet face and not at the stop end; the dimple is larger than the bump; and the catch follows the slide axis on a box that slides along Y — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`

**Checkpoint**: No sliding type has a taper at either end of its channel; the emberleaf player card box's lid slides up to a flat stop; and a catch, where asked for, clicks at the mouth. **The first clause was reversed in Phase 27** — the back taper is a seat and belongs there; only the *catch* had to stop being a wedge.

---

## Phase 27: The back seat comes back, and the lid gets eased in (FR-002d, FR-002e, FR-002e0, FR-002e4)

**Purpose**: Phase 26 read the back dovetail as the wedge catch and removed it. It is not: because the lid's leading taper matches the seat's, the two faces stay parallel for the whole travel and nothing is ever forced. Removing it left the lid's leading end resting on nothing, standing proud at the back. What genuinely had to go — a catch that works by deformation — was already replaced by the bump, and that stands.

**Goal**: The stop wall is dovetailed like the sides and the lid seats in it; the lid's corners are rounded and its leading edges chamfered so it starts in easily; and the seat is provably not a wedge.

**Independent Test**: The closed lid slides all the way out sharing zero volume with the body at every point, and jams within half a millimetre if lifted instead.

- [x] T280 [US2] Restore the stop-wall dovetail in `dovetail_track` (`pyboxbuilder/box/features.py`): `_dovetail_solid` takes the along-axis span at each face, and the difference between them is all at the closed end. The open end stays square so the lid finishes flush.
- [x] T281 [P] [US2] Write test: the stop wall keeps full thickness at the channel opening and half at the floor, the lid reaches into that seat, the closed lid **slides out with zero shared volume at every point** (SC-048 — the property that tells a seat from a wedge, which no cross-section can), and lifting it jams within half a mm — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`
- [x] T282 [US2] Round the lid's vertical corners (FR-002e4) via `lid_corner_rounding`: a quarter of the wall, capped at the dovetail depth, settable. Applied uniformly — pybosl2 0.7.8's per-corner `rounding` list **translates the whole solid** (a lid asked for `[0,0,r,r]` came out 23mm along the slide axis), and the trailing pair wants rounding anyway.
- [x] T283 [US2] Chamfer **both** horizontal edges of the leading end (FR-002d), and cut the default from half the lid thickness to a **quarter** — half takes a 2mm lid down to a 1mm knife edge, which is the wedge shape this whole area is avoiding.
- [x] T284 [US2] Fix the top chamfer, which looked right and measured absent, twice over: a vertical cutter leaves a feather edge because the leading face leans away from it going down, so its vertex must ride the face; and riding it *exactly* makes the surfaces coincident, which CSG resolves by keeping a zero-width sliver. Backed off by `_COINCIDENT_EPS_MM`.
- [x] T285 [P] [US2] Write test: corners rounded and both leading edges chamfered, each measured against the same lid with the feature switched off — a within-one-lid height comparison cannot tell a chamfer from the seat's own slope, and the first version of this test passed on the sliver — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`

**Checkpoint**: The player card box's lid seats at the back, slides out without deforming anything, and cannot be lifted out.

---

## Phase 28: Corner finger cutouts on a cap box (FR-002i–FR-002n)

**Purpose**: A cap lid is a friction fit over a smooth body, so there is nothing to get a fingertip behind and the only way off is to prise at the seam. The original toolkit cuts the body's band away at the four corners below the skirt; that was never ported.

**Goal**: Every cap box body carries a smooth cutout at each of its four corners, built from the same scoop as every other finger cut, and a box too short for the profile refuses to build rather than shipping a lid that cannot be removed.

**Independent Test**: Material is gone at all four corners and present at all four side midpoints; a short box raises naming the slipover alternative.

- [x] T286 [US2] Add `cap_finger_metrics` / `cap_finger_cutouts` to `pyboxbuilder/box/features.py` and subtract them in `cap_body`, composing four `corner_catch`es (FR-002i, FR-002j) — the same two-scoops-at-a-corner the slipover sleeve and the original's `CornerCatch` use.
- [x] T287 [US2] Size them (FR-002k–FR-002m): the two radii **4mm between them** (2mm rolling in, 2mm rolling out), a 2mm foot of body below the cut, and a run along each side of at least 10mm and at most a sixth of that side. Where a sixth is under 10mm the minimum wins — 10mm is a fingertip, a sixth is a preference.
- [x] T288 [US2] Raise below the smallest cap box the stack allows — `lid + 3mm skirt + 4mm curve + 2mm foot` (FR-002n) — naming the height, the minimum, each of its terms, and the slipover alternative. Shrinking the radii instead yields a cap box whose lid cannot be got off.
- [x] T291 [US2] Cap the skirt default so the cutout below it still fits (FR-002n1). Half the box height is a good skirt on a tall box and swallows a short one: at 11mm it took 5.5 and left the cut 5.5 for 4mm of curve and a 2mm foot, so the real floor was 12mm while the stack says 11mm. Floored at lid + 3mm; a tall box's skirt is untouched.
- [x] T292 [US2] Pass `top_rounding` / `bottom_rounding` through `corner_catch` to the scoop. Without them the cap box's radii were whatever the scoop derived from the half-width (~6.7mm), not the 2mm budget the spec sets — the numbers were checked and then not used.
- [x] T289 [US2] Offset each corner's cutter inward by half the band inset. `corner_catch` centres each arm's sweep **on** the wall it is given, so at a box corner half of it lay outside the box — 16mm³ came off four corners instead of 648mm³.
- [x] T290 [P] [US2] Write test: all four corners are cut and no side midpoint is (SC-051), the run is bounded both ways, a short side takes the fingertip minimum, a foot survives, both radii meet the minimum even when a smaller one is asked for, a too-short box raises naming the slipover, the minimum is **exactly** `lid + 3 + 4 + 2` (11.0 builds, 10.9 raises), a tall box's skirt is unchanged (SC-052), and the cut does not open into the closed lid — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`

**Checkpoint**: Cap boxes open by their corners; short ones say so.

---

## Phase 29: Default finger holes on a no-lid box (FR-047)

**Purpose**: An open tray has no lid to grip, so it is lifted by the rim. The original cuts a finger dip into both walls of the longer dimension; that was never wired into the no-lid type.

**Goal**: Every no-lid and path box carries a finger hole in each of its longer walls, sized after the original, skipped when the wall is too short, and opt-out via `auto_finger_holes=False` or an explicit `finger_hole(side)`.

**Independent Test**: `no_lid_finger_holes(spec)` returns two holes with radius `min(20, min(length, width)/4, height - floor + 1)`, height `min(radius, height - 2 + 1)`, rounding 3mm, on the longer side; a wall too short yields none.

- [x] T293 [P] [US2] Write test: the sizing follows the original, the longer dimension picks the side, a hole too wide for its wall is skipped (SC-053), automatic holes are opt-out and yield to explicit ones, and a scoop much taller than `radius + rounding` gets a straight vertical throat (the circles' common tangent) — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`
- [x] T294 [US2] Implement `no_lid_finger_holes` / `add_no_lid_finger_holes` in `pyboxbuilder/box/shell.py` (FR-047) and wire them into `NoLidBox` and `PathBox`, with an `auto_finger_holes` flag on `BoxBuilder`. The default holes are cut by the same `build_wall_scoop` as every other finger cut, and a wall too short for the mouth drops the hole rather than shrinking it.

**Checkpoint**: No-lid trays lift by their longer walls; a short-sided path box goes out sound.

---

## Phase 29: Good defaults as the governing rule, and two slipover corrections (FR-000, FR-002o, FR-002p)

**Purpose**: The spec had no stated position on API simplicity, so each design section argued its defaults locally with nothing to appeal to. It now has one, and it is the rule the rest answer to.

**Goal**: A user describes the game — sizes, contents, labels — and gets printable files, changing no geometric parameter.

**Independent Test**: Every shipped example builds and exports without setting a single geometric override (SC-000).

- [x] T293 Add the governing principle to the spec (FR-000, FR-000a–d) and to the plan as the section every design section answers to: derive don't fix; a feature needing an override does not work; refuse rather than degrade. Success measured by SC-000 — no example sets a geometric override.
- [x] T294 Switch 1835's two money boxes (9.5mm, 8.5mm) from cap to **slipover**, in `boxes/1835/1835.py` and in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_1835.py`, which builds its own copy of the layout. Both are under the smallest cap box that can carry a corner finger cutout.
- [x] T295 Halve the slipover sleeve's wall to `wall_thickness / 2` (FR-002o) in `slipover_metrics`. It was a full wall: a second wall carrying nothing, costing the interior two full walls of width across every axis.
- [x] T296 Stop the sleeve a gap short of the foot (FR-002p): skirt = `height - foot - gap`, gap a quarter of the covered height held between 3mm and 6mm, so there is a band of body to grip all the way round rather than a closed seam.
- [x] T297 Grow the cap cutout's curve budget from its 4mm floor to 6mm where the box can spare it (FR-002k), computing the minimum box size from the floor so growing it never raises the minimum.
- [x] T298 Write test: the sleeve's wall is half the box wall, the sleeve stops a gap short of the foot with the gap bounded at 3mm and 6mm, and the cap cutout's curve grows on a tall box while the 11mm minimum holds — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py`

**Checkpoint**: Examples build with no geometric overrides; slipover sleeves are half-wall and grippable.

## Phase 30: The corner indent's depth, and the U's two curves (FR-002q, FR-043e)

**Purpose**: Two defects that a render could not show and a measurement did — both in shared scoop helpers, so both were wrong everywhere they were used.

**Goal**: A cap box's indent is exactly the lid's offset deep, and a scoop's floor fillet is sized from the throat radius rather than the rounding radius.

**Independent Test**: Probing inward at mid-cut height, the indent's material begins at the lid offset; changing the rounding radius alone leaves the floor fillet unchanged.

- [x] T299 Move the arm offset into `corner_catch` (FR-002q). `build_wall_scoop` puts its wall on the far side of the compartment origin, so each arm landed at `[-wall, 0]` across the face; the cap box compensated with half a wall, which was half of what it needed — the indent cut 0.5mm of the 1.15mm asked for. Fixing it in `corner_catch` fixes the slipover's notches too, which were shallow for the same reason and had never been measured.
- [x] T300 Drop the compensating shift in `cap_finger_cutouts` so the indent is exactly the lid's offset deep, and the recess and skirt lie in one plane.
- [x] T301 Stop splatting `_fit_radii` into `scoop_outline` in `build_wall_scoop` (FR-043e). It returns `(flare, rise, r2)`; `scoop_outline` takes `(top_rounding, bottom_rounding, top_rise)`. The floor fillet was getting the top roll's rise — 1.6x the flare, a function of the *rounding* radius — so both curves of the U were driven by one number. On a 14mm scoop the bottom curve was 7.72mm where it should be 6.28mm.
- [x] T302 [P] Write test: the indent measures the lid's offset deep (SC-053), and the floor fillet tracks the throat radius while the top roll tracks the rounding radius (SC-054) — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_closures.py` and `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_finger_smoothing.py`

**Checkpoint**: Indents are the depth they claim; the U's two curves are sized from the two quantities that decide them.

## Phase 31: The lidless rim's inner edge, and the scoop's square base (FR-043f, FR-043g)

**Purpose**: An open tray's rim is exposed on both faces but only the outer edge was rounded; and a wall scoop's flat bottom meets the wall's faces at the wall's sawn cross-section.

**Goal**: Both edges of a lidless rim are rounded by `wall_thickness / 2`, and nothing a finger meets in a scoop is a square edge.

**Independent Test**: A lidless box's inner top edge is rounded by the same radius as its outer one; a lidded box's is not.

- [x] T303 Round the **inner** top edge of a hollow lidless box by the same radius as the outer one (FR-043f). **Done** — `round_inner_rim` in `pyboxbuilder/box/shell.py` subtracts the fillet ring described below: the interior perimeter swept with `roundover_profile`, flared outward by the radius over the last radius of the rim and mirrored into place, since `offset_sweep` carries a rim's last offset along its straight middle and so has to be given the flare as its *first* rim. Measured on the probe below: 6.0mm³ → 4.66mm³ of wall at the rim. Radius capped at `wall_thickness / 2`, because the outer edge is taking the same fillet from the other side. **Previously attempted and reverted**: calling `round_edges` over the *interior* envelope is a no-op, and measurably so — the wall material at the inner rim went 7.2mm³ → 7.17mm³. `round_edges` subtracts the sliver between an envelope's sharp edge and its arc, which for the interior envelope lands in the hollow, not in the wall. The inner rim is a convex edge **of the wall**, so it needs a fillet ring subtracted at the interior's top perimeter — a quarter-round tangent to the inner face and to the top face — not an envelope rounding. The outer half of FR-043f already works: `Project` sets `rim_free` for lidless types.
- [x] T303a [P] Write test: the inner rim loses wall material to its fillet on a lidless box and does not on a lidded one (SC-055). The probe must straddle the **inner face** at the top; a probe inset into the interior measures empty space in both cases and passes nothing.
- [x] T304 [P] Write test: a lidless box's inner top edge is rounded by the body radius and a lidded box's is not (SC-055) — in `tests/test_pyboxbuilder/test_rounding.py`
- [ ] T305 Round the wall scoop's **flat bottom** where it emerges on each face (FR-043g). The cut's bottom is a horizontal plane through the wall and currently ends in the wall's sawn cross-section: the face fillet follows the U's sides but the base reads as a square shelf, which is also why the dip does not look like a dip. Candidates measured so far: the face fillet not reaching the bottom run of the outline, and `MIN_FLAT_BOTTOM_RATIO` leaving a flat bottom 0.7x the scoop's width so there is little dip to see.

- [x] T306 A wall scoop's solid is **taller than the height it was asked for**, and its placement ignores the difference. Measured: `build_wall_scoop(..., reach=14, wall_thickness=2)` returns a solid spanning z -0.20..16.00 — 2mm proud at the top (`RIM_OVERSHOOT_MM` plus the `rounding_edge` flare, `wall_thickness / 2`) and 0.20 below (the intended floor dip). `apply_finger_holes` then places it at `interior_top - reach`, which is the *nominal* height, so neither end lands where `reach` says: the top overshoots the rim by 2mm and the bottom sits 0.20 lower than intended. **Fixed by sizing the outline, not by moving the solid**: raising the whole scoop by the flare corrects the bottom and carries the top up with it, so the roll finishes a flare above the rim and the top face meets it sliced through mid-curve (FR-043a wants it tangent). `apply_finger_holes` now builds the outline `reach - flare` tall and hangs it from `interior_top`, which puts the roll's tangent at the rim and the flare's deepest point exactly `reach` below it; the lidded types' `top_limit` trims at the outline's own top, which is the same plane. Note the `no_lid_finger_holes` radius formula also carries a `+1` (`height - floor_thickness + 1`), which on a box where `reach` is capped by the interior depth puts the cut into the floor before the dip is even added.

**Checkpoint**: Open trays are rounded on both rim edges; finger scoops present no sawn edge. **Partly reached** — T303/T303a/T304 and T306 are done; T305 is still open.
