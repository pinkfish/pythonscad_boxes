    One slot does both halves of the job, because they are the same slot: it
    leaves the interior clear at the top and bites half the wall width into
    each side wall at the bottom, to make the dovetail grooves, and it runs out
    through the far end wall so the lid has somewhere to enter. The groove is
    therefore wider at its floor than at its opening, which is what traps the
    lid: it can be slid along the axis but never lifted straight out. The
    groove never reaches the outer face — half the wall always remains behind
    it — so the walls still support the lid. Cutting only the grooves leaves a
    box with a solid wall across the front of its own track — a lid that can be
    dropped in but never slid.

    **The stop wall carries a dovetail too** (FR-002e), cut to the same depth as
    the sides: full thickness at the channel opening, half of it at the channel
    floor. That is a *seat*, not a catch. The lid's leading end is tapered to
    match, so the two faces stay parallel with the slide clearance between them
    for the whole travel — the lid slides in freely and lands in the seat — but
    once home, lifting the back of the lid drives its leading lip straight into
    the stop wall. Without it the leading end rests on nothing and the lid sits
    proud at the back.

    What must *not* be here is a **wedge catch**: a taper the lid has to be
    forced past to close and sprung back out to open. Nothing in this geometry
    interferes at any point in the travel, which is the property to check — a
    matched taper and a wedge look alike in a render and differ entirely in
    the hand. Holding the closed lid shut is :func:`sliding_catch`'s job, and
    that is a bump and dimple.

    The lid is the matching solid, cut short by `sliding_slack` on every mating
    face so it slides freely, with its two leading corners rounded and its
