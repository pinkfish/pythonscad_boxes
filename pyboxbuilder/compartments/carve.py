"""Turn a laid-out set of compartments into the solid that gets cut from a body.

`layout_compartments` decides *where* things go; this module builds *what* is
removed. It handles three kinds of compartment:

* a plain rectangular well (optionally with rounded corners and a finger scoop),
* a silhouette well driven by `shape_file`,
* an element pack — many individual silhouettes at their own offsets, rotations
  and depths inside one bounding box (FR-004b).

Everything is returned in the box's own coordinate frame, so a caller only has
to subtract it from the body.
