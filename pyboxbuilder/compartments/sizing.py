"""Compartment row-width distribution (T052a / FR-004).

The shelf packer in `layout.py` places compartments at their requested size and
leaves whatever is left over as dead space at the end of each row. This module
takes a finished row and grows its members so the row fills the interior width
exactly, which is what you want for card wells and token trays that should butt
up against the box walls.
