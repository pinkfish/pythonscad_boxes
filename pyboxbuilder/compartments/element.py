"""Compartment elements — individual game components nested inside a compartment.

A `CompartmentElement` is one physical piece (a worker meeple, a hero standee, a
hex tile, a wooden marker) with its own silhouette, its own local (x, y) offset
inside the owning compartment, its own rotation and its own depth. A compartment
that carries elements is an *element pack*: the elements are positioned in a local
frame and the pack's bounding box is what the box-level layout engine sees, so the
pack behaves exactly like one ordinary rectangular compartment (FR-004b).

Geometry generation delegates to pybosl2 and is only imported when a cutout is
actually built, so the layout maths stays importable without PythonSCAD.
