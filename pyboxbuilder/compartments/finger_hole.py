"""Finger scoop and notch geometry for compartment walls and floors.

Ported from the original toolkit's ``FingerHoleWall`` and ``FingerHoleBase``
(``components.scad``), which are the reference for how a finger cut is meant to
be smoothed. Three separate roundings are at work, and they are easy to
conflate:

1. **The mouth** (``rounding_radius``) — the top of the profile flares outward
   into the compartment rim with a pair of concave fillets, so the opening
   curves into the wall instead of ending in a right-angle lip. This is the
   part a fingertip actually rides over.
2. **The faces** (``rounding_edge``) — the sweep's two ends get a *negative*
   (concave) rim, so where the cut emerges on each side of the wall it flows
   onto that face tangentially rather than leaving a sharp shadow line. Each
   face is independently switchable, because the outside of a box wants the
   softening far more than a compartment-internal divider does.
3. **The base** — a floor scoop additionally fillets the cut into the floor
   plane, so the bottom of the cut blends into the box's inside surface.

Both helpers return cutouts in the compartment's own frame: (0, 0, 0) is the
compartment's lower-left corner at its floor, the footprint runs out to
(comp_width, comp_length), and +Z is up towards the rim.

    The **edge** profile from :func:`scoop_profile` — flat bottom, straight
    throat, rolled rim — swept through the wall, with a
    concave rim on each end so the cut flows onto the wall's faces instead of
    ending in a sharp line (``FingerHoleWall``'s ``rounding_edge``).

    **The sweep is exactly the wall thickness, centred on the wall** (the
    original passes ``depth_of_hole = wall_thickness + 0.03``), and that is
    load-bearing rather than incidental: a face fillet is produced by flaring
    the sweep's *end*, so the end has to coincide with the face. Overshooting
    the wall by a millimetre — the obvious way to make sure a boolean leaves no
    skin — puts both fillets out in the air beyond the box and leaves the cut
    meeting the faces at a hard edge after all. The 0.03 of fudge is the whole
    margin available.

    The sweep runs from the compartment floor to the rim, so a finger can reach
    the last card at the bottom of the stack, and is clipped at the floor plane
    so the box's base is not breached from the outside.

    Args:
        comp_width: Compartment footprint width.
        comp_length: Compartment footprint length.
        comp_depth: Compartment depth; the scoop runs its full height.
        side: Which wall to notch.
        radius: Notch radius in mm, capped so it cannot swallow the compartment.
        wall_thickness: Wall the cut passes through. Sets the sweep depth and,
            by default, the face fillet.
        rounding_radius: ``r1`` — how far the mouth rolls out at the rim.
            ``None`` derives it as half the throat half-width, so the roll
            stays in proportion to the scoop.
        bottom_rounding: ``r2`` — the fillet from the throat into the flat
            bottom. ``None`` derives it as half the throat width.
        rounding_edge: Fillet where the cut emerges on a face. Defaults to
            ``wall_thickness / 2``, the largest fillet the wall has room for
            (and what the original uses). ``0`` squares the edge.
        round_inner: Fillet the compartment-side face.
        round_outer: Fillet the outward face — the visible outside of the box.
        breach_floor: Let the cut run as deep as the flare naturally reaches,
            with no clip at all. Off by default.
        floor_thickness: The box floor under this compartment. Used to size the
            dip below the well floor (half the floor, at most 1mm), which is
            what keeps the cut's bottom face off the floor plane.
        floor_clearance: Dip below the well floor, overriding the value derived
            from ``floor_thickness``. ``0`` clips exactly at the floor, at the
            cost of a coincident face.
        top_limit: Height, in the cut's own frame, above which it is trimmed
            away — the guard for material that must not be cut into.
        roll_rise: How far the mouth roll reaches down; ``None`` derives it
            from the flare (FR-043c3). Width and gentleness are separate
            settings, so a shallow wall can have a gentler curve without a
            wider mouth.
        closed_top: Build a **closed window** (:func:`window_outline`) instead
            of a top-opening scoop. For a cut with wall standing above it,
            where there is no surface for the mouth roll to roll onto and a
            trimmed-off scoop would meet the faces at a square edge
