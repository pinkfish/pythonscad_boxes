"""Guillotine box packer for densely-filled inserts (T187).

The extreme-point First-Fit-Decreasing solver in `layout.py` places boxes at
corner points, which fragments the free space: above roughly 70% fill it cannot
find arrangements that demonstrably exist. Emberleaf is the standing example --
18 boxes at 77% fill, whose sizes tile exactly in three columns, and which
266,000 random permutations of that solver never packed.

This solver searches a different space. Instead of tracking corner points it
tracks free *regions*, and placing a box cuts the region it went into. Three
things make that work where the corner-point search did not:

**Support is structural, not checked.** A box may only be opened above another
box's own top face, or above a layer that is required to be filled solid (see
`Region.full`). The corner-point search floats a box with one corner resting on
another; bolting an explicit support test onto it made the search 3000x more
expensive and it still failed.

**Feasibility depends on region sizes alone.** The regions are disjoint, so
where they are cannot affect whether the remaining boxes fit -- only how big
they are. That makes the memo key position-free, which is what keeps the state
count small enough to search exhaustively.

**Smallest region first.** The fail-first principle, and the single biggest
lever here: the most constrained region has the fewest options, so a dead end
surfaces immediately instead of after the rest of the box is filled around it.
Measured on Emberleaf, taking the largest region first fails to find any packing
in 1,000,000 nodes; taking the smallest finds one in 3,237.
