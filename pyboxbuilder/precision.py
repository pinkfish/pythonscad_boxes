"""Curve precision — the ``fn`` / ``fa`` / ``fs`` tessellation controls.

Every curved feature the toolkit builds (cylinders, spheres, fillets and
chamfers, finger scoops and holes, lid-pattern curves) takes its facet count
from the precision in force, so one setting on :meth:`~pyboxbuilder.project.Project.export` or
:meth:`~pyboxbuilder.project.Project.show` reaches all of them. No geometry call hardcodes a facet
count the caller cannot override.

The setting travels in a :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` rather than through
every function signature: the geometry call sites are several layers below the
public API and threading a parameter through each of them would put a
precision argument on functions that have nothing else to do with it.

An export is the geometry that gets **printed**, so it is worth paying for:
at 256 facets a curve is smooth well past the resolution of any FDM nozzle,
and the cost is paid once per build rather than on every interaction.

A preview deliberately does **not** use this. :meth:`~pyboxbuilder.project.Project.show` leaves
``fn`` unset so ``fa``/``fs`` size the facets by how big the curve actually
is, which is what keeps an interactive render responsive. Pass an explicit
``fn`` to either one to override.

Print quality is for the 3MFs you actually send to a slicer, and it costs real
time: Irish Gauge's 32 files take about 90 seconds at 256 facets against a few
seconds at the fa/fs default. **A CI pass is not a build** — it checks that the
pipeline names, counts, caches and deletes the right files, and none of that
depends on how finely a cylinder is tessellated — so CI sets this coarse and
never produces printable output. Application code should pass ``fn`` to
:meth:`~pyboxbuilder.project.Project.export` explicitly rather than set this.
