"""Apply a `LidBuilder` to a lid's geometry (T161 / US9).

Every box type produces a bare lid; this is where it gets its label, its
through-hole pattern and its colours. Doing it here rather than in each box type
means all thirteen types decorate identically, and a new type gets decoration
for free.

The decoratable face is derived from the lid's own bounding box — its top, inset
by the border margin — so no box type has to declare where its flat area is.

Colour handling differs by export mode, which is the whole reason this returns a
pair rather than one solid:

* **mmu** — the label stays a separate coloured object so the slicer can give it
  its own material.
* **single** — the label is engraved into the lid instead, because a raised
  label in one colour is invisible.
