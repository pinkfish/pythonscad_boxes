"""Declarative layout — say how the boxes are arranged, not where they sit (T186).

There is a gap between the two ways of placing boxes. Free-form packing works
below roughly 70% fill and gives up above it; explicit coordinates always work
but have to be recomputed by hand whenever a box changes size. Real inserts sit
in that gap: they are densely packed *and* highly structured — three columns of
stacked trays, not an arbitrary arrangement.

This module lets the structure be written down and the coordinates derived:

    project.arrange(columns(
        rows(                                        # left column
            stack("PlayerBoxBlack", "PlayerBoxYellow"),
            stack("PlayerBoxRed", "PlayerBoxBlue"),
        ),
        rows("CardBoxFavor", "CardBoxHero"),         # middle column
    ))

`columns` runs along X, `rows` along Y, `stack` along Z. Groups nest freely, so
a stack can end in a pair of rows. Each child starts where the previous one
ended; a group is as wide as its widest child on the axes it does not consume.
