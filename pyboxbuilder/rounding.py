"""Rounding a box's exposed edges (FR-043, FR-044).

Nothing a hand grips should be a sharp 90° edge, which means the outer vertical
corners, the bottom edges and the top rim of every printed piece.

Rounding here is done by **subtracting the corner slivers** rather than by
intersecting with a rounded envelope. Both give the same rounded edges on an
ordinary box, but the intersection also silently trims anything reaching outside
the declared envelope — and a hinge barrel legitimately does (Phase 18 allows it
as the one bounded exception). Subtracting only the material a rounding would
remove leaves such features alone.

The radius defaults to ``wall_thickness / 2``: the largest fillet a wall can
carry while leaving half its thickness as flat face, and small enough to stay
clear of the lid features cut into the same walls.

   it gets a single segment and prints — and renders — as a **chamfer**.
2. A rounded edge is an *inscribed* polygon, so the face it blends into is
   pulled in by the sagitta, ``r · (1 - cos(180°/fn))``. That shrinks the box
   below its declared size, which the packer and the spacers both rely on. At

    subtractive solid hollows a cove *inside* the material and leaves the
    opening at nominal size — a cutout, not a roundover (FR-044e).

    The roundover is the mirrored arc, tangent to the **face**::
